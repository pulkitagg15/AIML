Oh, okay, much smaller number.  \\nSo as part of this class, especially in the homeworks, we'll ask you to implement a few \\nprograms, a few machine learning algorithms as part of the homeworks. And most of those homeworks will be done in either MATLAB or in Octave, which is sort of — I \\nknow some people call it a free version of MATLAB, which it sort of is, sort of isn't.  \\nSo I guess for those of you that haven't seen MATLAB before, and I know most of you \\nhave, MATLAB is I guess part of the programming language that makes it very easy to \\nwrite codes using matrices, to write code for numerical routines, to move data around, to \\nplot data. And it's sort of an extremely easy to learn tool to use for implementing a lot of \\nlearning algorithms.  \\nAnd in case some of you want to work on your own home computer or something if you \\ndon't have a MATLAB license, for the purposes of this class, there's also — [inaudible] \\nwrite that down [inaudible] MATLAB — there' s also a software package called Octave \\nthat you can download for free off the Internet. And it has somewhat fewer features than \\nMATLAB, but it's free, and for the purposes of this class, it will work for just about \\neverything.\")"
